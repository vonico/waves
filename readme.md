This is a secondary school project for physics, where you can calculate the wavelength or frequency of a wave (for electromagnetic or sound waves), as well as the interferences (just for sound waves). 

It started as a way for me to learn how to program while learning for school, as first I needed to understand how everything works, which I had some problems with. It also then helped me with my homework when having to calculate wavelengths or frequencies.

Because of it being my first python script, there are going to be quite a lot of bugs or functions that don't work as they should. 

I am not able to regularly update it and look if everything works as I just don't have the time due to school, so (in case someone is interested and even reads this) please report any problem(s) found.

Thank you :), 

Nico
